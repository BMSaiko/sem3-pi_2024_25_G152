# Guidelines

- **Task Responsibility**  
  - If a task has more than one assignee, designate one person as the primary responsible.

- **Testing Protocol**  
  - For tasks requiring testing, assign the testing role to someone other than the developer.

- **Attendance and Accountability**  
  - If a team member misses a daily meeting, attempt to gather their status regardless.
  - The **Scrum Master (SM)** should request a demonstration of their work to create constructive accountability.

- **Time Tracking**  
  - Record working hours for each task and User Story.

- **Bug Resolution**  
  - If a bug takes more than 2 hours to resolve, log it in the backlog.
