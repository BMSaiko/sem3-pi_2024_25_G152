## Sprint Performance

### Task Distribution

#### **Work by Team Member**

- **Bruno Miguel da Silva (1221514)**
  
  - **Board and Repository Creation:** Set up the project board and repository to organize and manage project tasks.
  
  - **Team Formation:** Established and coordinated the team, ensuring all members were onboarded effectively.
  
  - **Task Division:** Allocated tasks among team members based on individual strengths and project requirements.
  
  - **Product Backlog for Sprint 1:** Developed the initial product backlog, outlining the tasks and user stories for the first sprint.
  
  - **Reporting and Retrospectives:** Managed status reports and conducted retrospective meetings to evaluate sprint performance.
  
  - **User Stories:**
    - **USBD04:** *As a Product Owner, I want to import data from a legacy system and deliver it on a spreadsheet.*
    
    - **USEI01:** *Define the adequate data structures to store the information imported from the files.*
    
    - **USEI05:** *Present a list of workstations with total time of operation, and percentages relative to the operation time and total execution time, sorted in ascending order of the percentage of execution time relative to the total time.*
  
  - **Presentations:** Delivered presentations for LPRA3, BDDAD, and ESINF projects.

- **Miguel Gonçalves (1221119)**
  
  - **User Stories:**
    - **USBD01:** *As a Product Owner, I want a data dictionary/glossary to be created.*
    
    - **USBD05:** *As a Production Manager, I want to know, for each product, the orders to be delivered (customer, product, quantity, date) within a given time frame.*
    
    - **USBD06:** *As a Production Manager, I want to know the types of workstations used in a given order.*
  
    - **USEI02:** *Implement a simulator that processes all the items according to the following criteria:*
      - **AC1:** The simulator should create a preliminary queue for each operation, containing all the items whose next operation (according to the sequential production process) is that of the specified queue.
      - **AC2:** The items in the queue should be assigned based on the processing availability to the available machine capable of performing the required operation faster, in the order of their entry into the queue.
    
    - **USEI05:** *Present a list of workstations with total time of operation, and percentages relative to the operation time and total execution time, sorted in ascending order of the percentage of execution time relative to the total time.*
  
  - **Presentations:** Delivered presentations for LPRA3, BDDAD, and ESINF projects.

- **Vitor Carneiro (1240580)**
  
  - **User Stories:**
    - **USBD02:** *As a Product Owner, I want the relational model to be created (logical level).*
      
      - **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - The data model should cover the industrial facility’s activity described in the document, as well as any additional requirements resulting from the provided user stories.
        - **Minimum Expected Requirement:** A complete model in Visual Paradigm, including all connections and constraints, which allows the physical model script to be automatically generated.
        - **Above Expected Requirement:** The presentation of a conceptual model developed in Visual Paradigm in addition to the expected level.
    
    - **USBD03:** *As a Product Owner, I want the relational model to be instantiated (physical level).*
      
      - **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - It will be shown on Oracle LiveSQL.
        - **Minimum Expected Requirement:** Automatic generation from Visual Paradigm (centralized change management).
    
    - **USBD07:** *As a Production Manager, I want to know the materials/components to be ordered to fulfill a given production order, including the quantity of each material/component.*
  
  - **Presentations:** Delivered presentations for BDDAD project.

- **Tomás Teixeira Silva (1240590)**
  
  - **User Stories:**
    - **USBD09:** *As a Plant Floor Manager, I want to get the operations sequence as well as get the respective type of workstation, from a BOO of a given product.*
  
  - **Presentations:** Delivered presentations for BDDAD project.

- **Tiago Silva (1241707)**
  
  - **User Stories:**
    - **USLP01:** *As a Product Owner, I want the domain model to be created (conceptual level). This model will be an essential communication element between all the stakeholders. The domain model diagram is a “dynamic” document, which should continuously reflect the stakeholders’ shared understanding of the domain.*
      - **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - The data model should cover the activity of the industrial facility, excluding the simulation tool.
        - **What is Expected:** A “basic” model shared in Visual Paradigm or the documentation in GitHub (e.g., PlantUML).
  
  - **Presentations:** Delivered presentations for LPRA3 project.

- **Jorge Almeida (1220838)**
  
  - **User Stories:**
    - **USBD08:** *As a Plant Floor Manager, I want to know the different operations the factory supports.*
  
  - **Presentations:** Delivered presentations for BDDAD project.

- **Leonardo Coelho (1171317)**
  
  - **Notes:** Only handling physics; no assigned tasks.
