| Product          | An Item that can be final or a component (can be differentiated by some atributes).                                                                                                                        | Texto             | Também conhecido como "linha de produção" ou "fábrica".            |
| Part | A Part consistes in every kind of items, can be a product, component or even a raw material|||
| Components | Parts that make up the final product but are not sold separately. Each component may, in turn, consist of other components.|||
| Raw Materials | Basic materials used in the production of components, which cannot be broken down into smaller parts within the context of the product in question.|||
| Product Family   | Group of products with similar operation sequence but with diferent characteristics (material, size) in other words is an abastraction of product.                                                                      |||
| Costumer/Client         | An individual or company who places an order. Clients are identified primarily by their tax identifcation number (NIF), with additional information stored, such as names, adresses, and contact details.                     |||
| Order            | A Client request that can include one ir more items, each with its owndelivery details (date, location). Orders store customer information like Identification (NIF), name, and delivey address.                             |||
| BOM              | Bill of Materials, tree representation with final products (root), raw materials (leaf nodes), and components (intermediate nodes), as well as the required quantities of each of those elements to produce the final product. |||
| BOO              | Bill of Operatins, a group of several operations with one or more possible sequences throughout its production process, it`s also represented by a tree-like structure.                                                        |||
| Production Order | Created form an order, this includes the list of materials (BOM) and operations (BOO) necessary to product each intem. Each item from an order has a distinct production order.                                                |||
| Operation        | The specific tasks performed to produce a product, operations include cutting, drilling, gluing, assembly, polishing, varnishing and painting.                                                                                 |||
| WorkingStation | A work area that may include robotic units, automated machines, human-operated machines, or manual workstations. Each station can perform specific manufacturing operations and has its own production capacity.               |||
| Layout | The physical arrangement of stations on the factory floor, which impacts how products move through the production process.                                                                                                     |||
| Capacity Planning | Basic materials used in the production of components, which cannot be broken down into smaller parts within the context of the product in question.|||
| Product Plannig | The process of deciding what to produce, how much, and when, ensuring efficient use of resources to meet demand. |||
| Product Control | The monitoring and management of the production process to ensure it aligns with the plan, making adjustments as needed.|||
| System Users | Individuals or roles in a management information system (MIS) who interact with the system to carry out specific tasks related to the operation and management of processes in a manufacturing facility or organization. Each user has a distinct profile with unique responsibilities and permissions, ensuring the system is used effectively and efficiently.|||
| Minimum Viable Product (MVP) | Basic version of a product with just enough features to attract early users and validate the concept. |||
