# Documentation: Installation and Execution of the Script “script_legacy.py”

## 1. Requirements

Before you start, make sure your development environment is set up correctly.

### System requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS or Linux.
- Python 3.x: The script is designed to run on Python 3.x.

### Python Package Requirements

- `pandas`
- `openpyxl`

These packages are necessary for manipulating Excel files and generating SQL queries.

---

## 2. Python installation

If you don't already have Python 3.x installed, follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of Python 3.x.
3. During installation, make sure you check the **“Add Python to PATH”** option.
4. Check the installation by opening a terminal (cmd or PowerShell on Windows) and typing:

   ```bash
   python --version

The result should be something like Python 3.x.x.

## 3. Installing the Required Packages

This script depends on external Python packages, such as pandas and openpyxl. To install them, follow these steps:

Open the terminal or PowerShell.

Type the following command to install the required packages:

    pip install pandas openpyxl

Check that the installation was successful by running the command again without errors.

## Project structure

Here is the basic structure of the project:

    |-- script_legacy.py # The main script
    |-- Dataset01_v1.xlsx # The Excel file with the data
    |-- output_sql_queries.sql # The file where the SQL 
queries will be saved (generated by the script)

## 5. Execute the Script “script_legacy.py”

**Execution steps:
Make sure that the script_legacy.py file is in the same directory as the Excel file (Dataset01_v1.xlsx).

Open the terminal or PowerShell and navigate to the directory where the script_legacy.py file is located. **Use the command

    cd path/do/directory
    Example on Windows:

    cd C:\Users\your\name\Documents\project
**Run the script with the command:**

    python script_legacy.py
**What the Script Does:**
The script will open the Dataset01_v1.xlsx file and generate SQL queries based on the data found in the different Excel sheets.
The queries generated will be saved in the output_sql_queries.sql file.

**Success Message
If the script runs correctly, you will see a message in the terminal like:

    SQL queries successfully generated in file output_sql_queries.sql

Now, the **output_sql_queries.sql** file will contain all the **INSERT** queries generated from the data in the Excel file.

## Possible errors and solutions

    Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'

Make sure you have installed the packages correctly using the command **pip install pandas openpyxl.**
Encoding error **(UnicodeEncodeError)**

Make sure that the output file is being written with UTF-8 encoding, as mentioned in the script.
Error locating the Excel file

Check that the path to the Excel file is correct in the script. Update the line in the **Dataset01_v1.xlsx** file if necessary.

## Modifying the Script

If you need to modify the Excel file being processed, open the **script_legacy.py** file with a text editor (such as Notepad) and change the file path in the following line:

    excel_file = 'Dataset01_v1.xlsx' # Put the correct path of your Excel file
