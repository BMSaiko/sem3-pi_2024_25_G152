### Register Workstation Function

The `register_workstation` function adds a new workstation to the system.

#### Parameters:
- `p_WSID`: Unique ID of the workstation.
- `p_Name`: Name of the workstation.
- `p_Description`: Description of the workstation.
- `p_WTID`: Type ID of the workstation (must exist in `WorkstationTypes`).

#### Function Logic:
- Inserts a new record into the `Workstations` table.
- Returns:
  - `'Success: Workstation registered successfully'` if insert is successful.
  - `'Error: Workstation with this WSID already exists'` for duplicate ID.
  - `'Error: Workstation Type (WTID) not found'` for missing `WTID`.
  - Other SQL errors if applicable.

#### Example Usage:
- The function is called to register a workstation with ID `1001`.
- The result is printed using `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`.
